# Optimized Status Page with Live System Information

## Overview

The Pileup Buster API includes a `/status` endpoint that generates a fast, optimized HTML page displaying:
- Current system status (ACTIVE/INACTIVE) with clear visual indicators
- Currently active QSO callsign and operator information  
- Real-time queue with callsigns and positions
- Clickable link back to the frontend with status indication
- Timestamp information and system statistics

## Key Features

- **Fast Performance**: No screenshots - all content generated server-side
- **Real-time Data**: Shows current QSO and queue information directly from database
- **Mobile Responsive**: Clean, modern design that works on all devices
- **Live Status**: Instant updates without requiring browser refresh

## Usage

Access the status page at: `http://your-api-server/status`

## Configuration

Configure the frontend URL using the environment variable:

```bash
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Add this to your `.env` file or export it in your environment.
