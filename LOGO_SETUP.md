# Logo Setup Instructions

To complete the logo implementation:

1. Download the logo image from: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f4aa17c-7689-47a6-9984-a909cee4327d
2. Save it as `/frontend/src/assets/pileup-buster-logo.png`
3. Update the import in `/frontend/src/App.tsx` from:
   ```tsx
   import pileupBusterLogo from './assets/react.svg' // TODO: Replace with actual logo when available
   ```
   to:
   ```tsx
   import pileupBusterLogo from './assets/pileup-buster-logo.png'
   ```

The logo contains the character mascot with a radio tower and the text "PILEUP BUSTER" in yellow.
