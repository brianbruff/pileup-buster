# Logo Implementation Status

## Current Implementation
The logo has been successfully integrated into the header, replacing the hamburger menu and "PILEUP BUSTER" text. Currently using a placeholder SVG logo (`pileup-buster-logo.svg`) due to network restrictions during development.

## To Use the Actual Logo (Optional)
If you want to replace the placeholder with the actual logo:

1. Download the logo image from: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f4aa17c-7689-47a6-9984-a909cee4327d
2. Save it as `/frontend/src/assets/pileup-buster-logo.png`
3. Update the import in `/frontend/src/App.tsx` from:
   ```tsx
   import pileupBusterLogo from './assets/pileup-buster-logo.svg'
   ```
   to:
   ```tsx
   import pileupBusterLogo from './assets/pileup-buster-logo.png'
   ```

## Current Features
- Responsive logo sizing (60px desktop, 50px tablet, 40px mobile)
- Proper aspect ratio maintenance with `object-fit: contain`
- Clean header layout with logo on left, admin login on right
- Placeholder logo includes radio tower icon and "PILEUP BUSTER" text in yellow

The actual logo contains the character mascot with a radio tower and the text "PILEUP BUSTER" in yellow.
